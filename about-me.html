            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Nate Boone, and I'm a game design student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I've been
                doing game development
                since I was 7 years old, and I've always known that it's what I've wanted to do. I always make sure to
                put the best I've got into each and every project that I work on.
                I've worked on a variety of projects, from my more recent web and desktop based projects to my older
                game development projects that I made when I was first teaching myself how to code and the development
                process.
                I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I'm excited to see where
                my career takes me. Here you can see what I've worked on for my classes and personal projects, and the
                different
                technologies I've used to make them.
